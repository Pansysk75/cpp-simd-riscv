## rvv::experimental::simd header only library for vectorization on RISC-V

This library contains SIMD API for RISC-V vectorization based on the idea of `std::experimental::simd` API. It has most basic functionality of std::experimental::simd, but does not strictly follow TS 19570, as the purpose is to experiment with performance.
